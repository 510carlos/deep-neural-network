# Welcome To The Code! 

Here is a collection of examples which helped me understand machine learning techniques. 
This helped me write AI agents with public data sets such as: MNIST.


### Convolutional Neural Network
  - TF-Learn
  - Deep CNN with MNIST Data Set
  - Example 1
### Recurrent Neural Network
  - Bi-Directional RNN
  - Dynamic RNN
  - RNN with MNIST Data Set
### Neural Network
  - Census: Estimate income
  - Example 1
### AutoEncoder
  -[Auto Encoder with MNIST Data Set](https://github.com/510carlos/deep-neural-network/blob/arrange/AutoEncoder/Auto%20Encoder.ipynb)
### Misc
  - Example 1
